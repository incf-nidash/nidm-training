    "This document provides an overview of the neuroimaging data model (NI-DM). It describes what led to the development of NI-DM, how it was derived from the W3C Provenance Data Model, and how it relates to other efforts to create metadata and other standards in brain imaging. In particular we note NI-DM's utility in context of other Semantic Web technologies. This document is a part of a collection of notebooks, which highlight the current work related to NI-DM and provide a tutorial introduction to creating and utilizing NI-DM applications."

    "\n",
    "[PROV-DM](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/) is the conceptual data model that forms a basis for the W3C provenance (PROV) [family of specifications](http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/WorkingDrafts).\n",

    "PROV-DM is organized in six components, respectively dealing with: (1) [entities and activities](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#section-entity-activity), and the time at which they were created, used, or ended; (2) [derivations](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#section-derivation) of entities from entities; (3) [agents](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#section-agents-attribution-association-delegation) bearing responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened; (4) a notion of [bundle](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#section-provenance-of-provnance), a mechanism to support provenance of provenance; (5) [properties to link entities](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#section-prov-extended-mechanisms) that refer to the same thing; and, (6) [collections](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#section-collections) forming a logical structure for its members [Source: PROV-DM](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/).\n",

    "## What is NI-DM?\n",
    "\n",
    "NI-DM is formulated as a domain specific extension of PROV-DM to specifically and simultaneously address data and provenance in neuroimaging. Currently, NI-DM maps identically to PROV-DM and domain specific extensions are captured as object models on top of PROV-DM.\n",
