Calib,mBIRN_calib,"This data set consists of spoiled gradient-recalled echo magnetic
resonance imaging data from five healthy volunteers (four males and one
female) scanned twice at four sites having 1.5T systems from different
vendors(Siemens, GE, Marconi Medical Systems).  Some subjects were also
scanned a single time at another site. One subject was only scanned twice
at three sites (subject 73213384) and once at another site. For each
subject, four Fast Low-Angle Shot (FLASH) scans with flip angles of 3, 5,
20, and 30 degrees were obtained in a single scan session, from which
tissue proton density and T1 maps can be derived. These data were acquired
to investigate various metrics of within-site and across-site
reproducibility.  This study was sponsored by the Brain Morphometry
testbed (MBIRN) of the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN). 
The images have been defaced so that no facial features can be
reconstructed from these data.

CENTRAL_OASIS_LONG,OASIS Longitudinal Studies,"The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a series of MRI data sets that is publicly available for study and analysis.  The present data set consists of a longitudinal collection of 151 subjects aged 60 to 98. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year.  All subjects were characterized using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) are either nondemented or with very mild to mild dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT).  77 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of each of their visits.  64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans.  Another 10 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at the time of one or more later visits. The subjects were all right-handed and include both men (n=62) and women (n=89).  For each scanning session, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained. Multiple within-session acquisitions provide extremely high contrast-to-noise making the data amenable to a wide range of analytic approaches including automated computational analysis. Automated calculation of whole brain volume and estimated total intracranial volume are presented to demonstrate use of the data for measuring differences associated with normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

Data Use Agreement&lt;/a&gt; first. 
As part of the growing field of Computational Anatomy (CA), our group has developed tools to identify and characterize abnormalities of brain structure in subjects with schizophrenia, some of which have the characteristics of disease endophenotypes. In this effort, we have collected high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) datasets from large cohorts of subjects using the same MR scanner platform and sequences. In addition, we have tested and validated atlas-based large-deformation diffeomorphic mapping tools for generating segmentations of brain structures as represented in high-resolution MR images. 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This project will make available MR images, demographic, clinical, neurocognitive and genotype data from 139 subjects with schizophrenia and 136 control subjects matched for age and gender, in a federated database.  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All MR data are in AnalyzeTM format.  The dataset includes high-resolution T1- (FLASH and MPRAGE) and T2- (TSE) weighted MR scans, in AnalyzeTM format.  The dataset also includes manual segmentation for: Hippocampus, Amygdala, Thalamus, Basal Ganglia (caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, globus pallidus), Cingulate gyrus, include the anterior, posterior segments, Prefrontal cortex (including superior, middle and inferior gyri), and Parahippocampal gyrus (including entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The clinical datasets include diagnosis, age, gender, parental socioeconomic status, as well as measures of the severity of psychopathology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The battery of neuropsychological tests includes tasks relevant to prior studies of cognition in schizophrenia. Tasks are grouped into the following four domains: Working Memory, Episodic Memory, Executive Function, Crystallized Intelligence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The genotyping data will include BDNF (rs6265), EGFR (rs10228436), FGF-2 (rs1048201), and IL-3 (rs40401).  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These data can be used to test and validate new brain mapping tools.
These data can be used to generate or test new hypotheses related to abnormalities of brain structures and neural networks in individuals with schizophrenia.
